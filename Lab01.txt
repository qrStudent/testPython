The exercises that you complete in this lab will give you a taste of programming.
You will read and write programs in Python - the programming language that we
will be learning this semester. You do not need to install any software to complete
this lab assignment. You need a computer with Internet access (either your personal
computer or any NYU public lab computer).

In this lab, we will be working in a cloud-based environment that allows us to
run programs and produce some graphics. This clound-based enviroment is called
Trinket.io  and you can access it via the following URL:  https://trinket.io/python
